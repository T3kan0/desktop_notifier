The code can be used for a variety of day-to-day purposes. I wrote the code for work, as Teaching Assistant and Tutor, I often invigilate tests and exams. The code helps me track the test/exam time without having to check my watch or the clock. Another important use is to track my study time, the code helped decided when to take breaks and when to work.
